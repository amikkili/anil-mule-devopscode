Ansible-Commands
================
step 1: do install 3 instances and make them  1 as Master and ther 2 as nodes 
step 2: once u launches ec2 instances run below commands 
 a. useradd ansible
 b. passwd ansible and provide password also as ansible 
 c. go to vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config and remove comment for Rootlogin and password authentication 
 d. go to vi /etc/sudoers and add ansible user there like ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
 e. strt the service--> service sshd start
 f. change the user --> su - ansible 
 g. create a rsa private key --> ssh-keygen -t rsa 
 h. restart the service--> sudo service sshd restart
 
above steps to perform in all the 3 instnces

below commands to perform only in Masternode 
 a. add public ip of the 2 nodes instances 
    ssh-copy-id <n1 public ip>
	ssh-copy-id <n2 public ip>
	type ansible user password there (b. passwd ansible and provide password also as ansible)
due to this the communication will estalish in master and nodes

 b. install ansible in master

    sudo amazon-linux-extras install ansible2 -y 
 c. check ansible version ansible --version
 d. open a file vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg and remove comment for inventory file 
 e. go to vi /etc/ansible/hosts and add nodes private ips under [webserers]
